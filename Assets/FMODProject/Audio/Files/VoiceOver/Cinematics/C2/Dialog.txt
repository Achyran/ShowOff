Because of my powers to communicate with the fish, i had made some friends.

For example Anthony the Anchovy, he is one of my closests friends underwater. He almost always joined me on my dives! 

When he is not with me, he usually swims around with his school of anchovies.

He still is young and insecure, so usually clings to me for safety when he gets scared. 

Some other friends i've made include Cody the Codfish

He has some baby fishes with his wife and lives in this coarse rock structure on the seabed. 
You want him to be on your side though, cause he is very strong and can knock you off your feet! Believe me i know! [laughs]

Ow, and then we have Sal the Sailfish. He is a playfull one, always swordfighting with his pointy bill. 
He can cut through almost anything with that thing.

But where was i? Ow yeah! After i finished the cave dive i went for a swim in the shallow part of the bay to find some of my friends.
