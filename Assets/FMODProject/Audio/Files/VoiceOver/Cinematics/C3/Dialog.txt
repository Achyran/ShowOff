It was good to free the whale from the nets, although Anthony was kind of scared of the big size of the whale.

It happened more often that fish would get stuck in old fishing nets, but i have never seen a whale stuck in one before.

But then a rumble came from above the water, dark clouds were rolling in from the ocean. 

A containership was caught right in the middle of it and bounced up and down on the waves

Containers fell overboard and into the ocean, sinking to the seabed. Some of them burst open and spread their contents over the ocean
