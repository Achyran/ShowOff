{"species":4,"speciesname":"Anchovy","description":"Anchovies are small fishes to swim around in groups. They are technically green in colour, but they almost look silver and blue when the light hits them. They are usually a bit nervous and look shy when you try to approach them, but I think theyâ€™re cute. ","image":{"instanceID":0},"UIText":"Discovered Anchovy","UIimage":{"instanceID":0}}
