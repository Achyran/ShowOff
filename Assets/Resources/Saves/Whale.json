{"species":0,"speciesname":"Whale","description":"Those whales are so majestic. They would probably be even more impressive from up close, although they might be a bit clumsy. It’s amazing to think that a creature like that can easily swim across the world to find food. They have a nice dark colour to their thick skin and are larger than the more known whales like the humpback. They are also a bit… rounder.","image":{"instanceID":0},"UIText":"","UIimage":{"instanceID":0}}
