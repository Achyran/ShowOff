{"species":3,"speciesname":"Atlantic Cod","description":"The Atlantic Cod is a bulky fish. They look cuddly to me, but for some reason they’re not really into that. They do live in groups, but most just mind their own business. They live close to the shoreline, because they are able to find more food there than in the open waters. They look a bit dull. They’re mostly brown or green with some spots on their fins.","image":{"instanceID":0},"UIText":"Discovered Cod","UIimage":{"instanceID":0}}
