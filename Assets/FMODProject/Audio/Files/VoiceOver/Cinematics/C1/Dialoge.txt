Hi There, my name is Mira and you might be wondering why i am here about to tell you this story.

To be honest, i want to teach you something. The ocean is beautifull and full of wonders!

The thing is, alot of people do not realise that the ocean is full of wonders and surprises! But to get back to my story...

Well you see, im not a normal teenage girl like the girls in my school.

They always tease me, because i prefer being under the water then being above water.

I mean, its beautiful under there! I always felt it was special and that i had a special connection with it.

Turns out i was right, cause you see, i have this ability to talk to all kinds of fish and swim with them like i  am one of their own!

Well i can keep talking abotut it, but it might be better to just show you. You see it all started one day when i went on a cave diveâ€¦.
